# IMDb Movie Search and Recommendation System

A Python application that scrapes IMDb's top 25 movies, allows fuzzy search for movie titles using Levenshtein distance, and vides movie recommendations based on description similarity using TF-IDF and cosine similarity, all accessible via a Gradio interface.

## Features
- **Web Scraping**: Extracts movie details (title, rank, year, duration, rating, description) from IMDb's Top 25 Movies list.
- **Fuzzy Search**: Finds movies even with misspelled titles using Levenshtein distance, with adjustable similarity thresholds.
- **Recommendation System**: Suggests similar movies based on description text using TF-IDF and cosine similarity.
- **Interactive Interface**: User-friendly Gradio interface for searching and viewing recommendations.
- **CSV Export**: Saves scraped movie data to a CSV file for further analysis.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Dependencies: `beautifulsoup4`, `requests`, `pandas`, `python-levenshtein`, `gradio`, `scikit-learn`
- Internet connection for scraping IMDb data

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/IMDb-Movie-Recommender.git
   cd IMDb-Movie-Recommender
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install beautifulsoup4 requests pandas python-levenshtein gradio scikit-learn
   ```
4. Ensure the `Top25_movie_imdb.csv` file is available if you want to skip scraping and use pre-existing data.

## Usage
1. Run the Jupyter notebook `Project.ipynb` to scrape data, generate the CSV, and launch the Gradio interface:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook "Project.ipynb"
   ```
2. Execute all cells to scrape IMDb data and launch the Gradio interface.
3. In the Gradio interface, enter a movie title (e.g., "Godfther" for "The Godfather") and adjust the similarity threshold (0.1 to 1.0) to search for movies and view recommendations.

### Example
**Input**:
- Movie Title: "Shawshank"
- Similarity Threshold: 0.7

**Output**:
```

## ject Structure
- `Project .ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook containing the scraping, search, and recommendation logic.
- `Top25_movie_imdb.csv`: Output CSV file with scraped IMDb data (generated by the notebook).
- `README.md`: This file.

## Notes
- The scraper targets IMDb's Top 25 Movies page (`https://www.imdb.com/chart/top/`). Ensure IMDb's structure hasn't changed to avoid scraping errors.
- The Gradio interface runs locally or in a hosted environment like Colab. For Colab, use `share=True` in `interface.launch()`.
- The fuzzy search threshold can be adjusted to balance strictness vs. flexibility in matching movie titles.
